-------------------------------------------------------------
![image](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/images/product/LED%20Strip%20Driver.jpg)

The LED Strip Driver with 4-pin Grove interface provides easy connectivity to your standard Arduino device or Seeed Stalker. It can help you control the luminance of a single-color LED strip, as well as the color and the luminance of an RGB LED strip through Arduino or Seeeduino.
 
It has 2 terminals and 2 Grove interfaces. The power for the LED strip comes in through the 2-pin terminal. And the LED controlling voltages output through the 4-pin terminal. The 2 Grove interfaces are respectively screen-printed “IN” (for controlling data input) and “OUT” (for controlling data shared with the next strip driver). 
 
It can drive an LED strip 1 to 2 meters long with 9 V, while 1 to 5 meters long with 12 V.  The driver in conjunction with the colorful LED strips can add a wonderful effect to indoor or outdoor usages.

**Note:**

This is a Suli-Compatible Library, You Should Download Suli for your platform, please refer to [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli "Suli")

If you can't find Suli for your platform, please contract us, If you can port it yourself and pull request to us, We'll be appreciated. 

***For Arduino:***

Just like you use the other Library, What's different is you should download Suli for Arduino First, remember that just put Suli for Arduino to your Arduino libraries folder.

***For non-Arduino Platform:***

For a non-Arduino platform, what you need is xxx.h and xxx.cpp(you can change it to xxx.c while your compiler can't support c++), the other files like xxx_Arduino.h and examples is for Arduino, you can just delete them.
